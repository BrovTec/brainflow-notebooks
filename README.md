# EEG Notebooks

## Getting Started

### Tutorials:
***Coming Soon*** we will have the following tutorials available:

* Setting up your OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV headset.
* First time running the notebooks.
* Adding an electrode to the Muse headband.

### Running the Notebooks
The notebooks can be run in one of two ways. The easiest way currently is to run the `run_notebooks.py` script which 
will provide options for the user to input their board type, desired experiment, and a few other options. This is the 
recommended method particularly because it provides all currently supported functionality of the library and saves the 
data in a universal directory and format. The individual experiments can also be run within a python terminal or jupyter
notebook by calling the individual submodules.
